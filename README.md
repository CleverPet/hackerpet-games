# hackerpet Games

The [CleverPet Hub][cleverpet.io] is a programmable device that lets you
automatically train and interact with other species. It's kind of like a "game
console for pets".

<p align="center"> <img width="460" src="docs/images/hub1.png"> </p>

The Hub is built on the [Particle][particle.io] platform, which means that the
full suite of tools Particle has built can be used to control the CleverPet Hub.

You can find the main Particle library to control the CleverPet hub in the
[hackerpet repository][hackerpet_repo] or on the
[build.particle.io][particle_lib] website.

This repository holds all the community submitted games that can be installed on
the hackerpet hub.

## How to install games

You can find the full list of available games in [games.md][games.md]. (a
computer readable list can be found in [games.json][games.json])  
The actual source code of the games can live in one of two places: either on
[build.particle.io][build.particle] or in this repository under the
[games][games_folder] folder.

Once you picked your game and clicked on its link you can end up:
*  on build.particle.io  
   Now you just click the `Copy This App` button and then hit the lightning bolt
   icon in the top left to install the game on your hub.
*  in the games folder in this repository  
   To install this game you'll have to first clone or download this repository.
   Then you can use the [particle-cli][particle_cli] or [Particle
   workbench][particle_vsc] for VSC to send the new game to your hub.

## How to submit games

You can add your own game to this list by simply submitting a pull request in
this repository.  
Make sure you update both the [games.md][games.md] and the
[games.json][games.json] files. If you want to also include your source in this
repository, you can make a new folder under the [games folder][games_folder]
named after your game. The directory structure of your game should follow the
standard Particle project structure. You can see an example of the structure in
the [`hello-world`][hello_world] game folder.

## Definitions

In the hackerpet libraries words such as "challenge", "interaction" etc. are used
in specific ways:

*  **Player:** Any dog, cat, person, or other animal who is playing with a Hub.

*  **Foodtreat:** A food reward. E.g., a dog treat, cat treat, or piece of
   kibble.

*  **Report:** A single row of data describing everything that a player did
   during an interaction.

*  **Interaction:** A presentation of lights, sounds from a Hub, and the
   corresponding responses of a player, ending with a report. Nearly always, an
   interaction begins with the Hub doing some things, the player doing some
   things in response, and then the player getting some feedback as to whether
   they did the right thing.

*  **Challenge:** A series of one or more interactions, usually of progressively
   increasing difficulty, and often designed to teach the player a particular
   skill. *Example: the Responding Quickly challenge where the pet has to go
   through several iterations of pushing multiple lit up buttons and getting
   foodtreats.*

*  **Challenge set:** A series of challenges, such as the collection of 13
   original CleverPet challenges.

*  **Level:** A stage of difficulty within a given challenge. Lower levels are
   easier, and each challenge usually has a fixed number of them.

*  **Game:** A fuzzy term, currently without precise technical definition,
   sometimes used interchangeably with "challenge", but which may consist of
   multiple challenges.

## Contributing

This is where things can get really fun. Want to add a new game, and perhaps see
how the community, or dogs, or cats, respond to it? Create your own fork and
submit a pull request. We'll chat about it as a community, and if it seems
sensible we'll add it to the collection of games!

To make this work, all contributors first have to sign the [CleverPet Individual
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][CLA], which is based on the Google CLA.
This agreement provides the CleverPet team with a license to re-distribute your
contributions.

Whenever possible, please follow these contribution guidelines:
- Keep each pull request small and focused on a single game, feature, or bug
  fix.
- Familiarize yourself with the code base, and follow the formatting principles
  adhered to in the surrounding code.
