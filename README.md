### Games to Teach your Player (dog, cat, pig, ...) to Use CleverPet
   CleverPet developed this sequence of games to teach players to use the CleverPet Hub's 
   touch interface, and are best played in the order below. When the player becomes proficient
   at the current challenge, switch them to the next one!

## How to install games

Once you've modified your Hub to work with hackerpet, the easiest way is to install a game is to just click the install icon (![install icon](./docs/images/install.png))! You'll then sign in to Particle and can choose which Photon you'd like to put the game on to. 

Alternatively, you can clone or download this repository, and then install the game to your Hub using one of:
   1. [particle-cli][particle_cli], 
   2. [Particle IDE (DEV)][particle_dev] (slightly easier to use), or
   3. [Particle Workbench][particle_vsc] (more sophisticated) for Visual Studio Code

## How to submit games

You can add your own game to this list by simply submitting a pull request (PR) in
this repository.
A few guidelines for assuring a quick PR approval:
* Please make sure you've tested the game and that you've succeeded at training a player to play it! 
* Please make sure that the game/app isn't a duplicate of others already here
* In your PR, make sure you update both this file and [games.json][games.json]
* Please submit one game per PR :)
* Ensure you've already completed the [CleverPet Individual
Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][CLA], which is based on the Google CLA. 

If you want to also include your source in this repository, you can make a new folder 
under the [games folder][games_folder] named after your game. The directory structure of
your game should follow the standard Particle project structure. You can see an
example of the structure in the [`hello-world`][hello_world] game folder.

## What's the CleverPet Hub? What's hackerpet? 

The [CleverPet Hub][cleverpet.io] is a programmable device that lets you
automatically train and interact with other species. It's kind of like a "game
console for dogs and cats".

<p align="center"> <img width="460" src="docs/images/hub1.png"> </p>

The Hub is built on the [Particle][particle.io] platform, and with **hackerpet** 
we've open-sourced CleverPet's player-training software, which means that the full 
suite of tools Particle has built can be used to control the CleverPet Hub. 

You can find the main Particle library to control the CleverPet Hub in the
[hackerpet repository][hackerpet_repo] or on the
[build.particle.io][particle_lib] website.


## Glossary

In the hackerpet libraries words such as "challenge", "interaction" etc. are used
in specific ways:

*  **Player:** Any dog, cat, person, or other animal who is playing with a Hub.

*  **Foodtreat:** A food reward. E.g., a dog treat, cat treat, or piece of
   kibble.

*  **Report:** A single row of data describing everything that a player did
   during an interaction.

*  **Interaction:** A presentation of lights, sounds from a Hub, and the
   corresponding responses of a player, ending with a report. Nearly always, an
   interaction begins with the Hub doing some things, the player doing some
   things in response, and then the player getting some feedback as to whether
   they did the right thing.

*  **Challenge:** A series of one or more interactions, usually of progressively
   increasing difficulty, and often designed to teach the player a particular
   skill. *Example: the Responding Quickly challenge where the pet has to go
   through several iterations of pushing multiple lit up buttons and getting
   foodtreats.*

*  **Challenge set:** A series of challenges, such as the collection of 13
   original CleverPet challenges.

*  **Level:** A stage of difficulty within a given challenge. Lower levels are
   easier, and each challenge usually has a fixed number of them.

*  **Game:** A fuzzy term, currently without precise technical definition,
   sometimes used interchangeably with "challenge", but which may consist of
   multiple challenges.
